**A Browser extension which automatically scrolls through all reels in any of your DMs seamlessly.**



## 🚀 The Problem

When scrolling Reels in Instagram DMs, each video opens in a popup and you have to manually close it before opening the next one, which means too many repetitive clicks.

## ✅ The Solution

## Features

*   **Automatic:** Automatically detect reels shared in DMs.

*   **Smooth:** Scroll to next reel with a smooth UI.

*   **Simple:** User-friendly controls for navigation.
