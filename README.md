**It automatically scrolls through all reels in any of your DMs seamlessly.**



## 🚀 The Problem

When scrolling Reels in Instagram DMs, each video opens in a popup and you have to manually close it before opening the next one, which means too many repetitive clicks.

## ✅ The Solution

This extension automatically closes the current reel and opens the next one for you, so you can keep scrolling without all the extra taps.

## Features

*   **Automatic:** Automatically detect reels shared in DMs.

*   **Smooth:** Scroll to next reel with a smooth UI.
